GDCM 1.2.5 Setup Instructions
Last Updated by Stuart Golodetz on 16/05/10
-------------------------------------------

1. Create a gdcm-1.2.5 subdirectory in the libraries directory.

2. Extract gdcm-1.2.5.tar.gz into the gdcm-1.2.5 directory.

	On Windows:

	a) Just extract it using something like the shareware version of WinRAR.

	On Linux:

	a) Change to the libraries/gdcm-1.2.5 directory.
	b) Run "tar xzf ../setup/gdcm-1.2.5/gdcm-1.2.5.tar.gz".

3. Rename the new gdcm-1.2.5 subdirectory of gdcm-1.2.5 to 'source'.

4. Configure GDCM using CMake and then build it.

	On Windows:

	a) Use the CMake GUI. Set the source and build directories to those in the gdcm-1.2.5 directory. The install directory (i.e. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX) should be set to a sibling of source and build called 'install'. Then just keep changing the options and configuring until you can generate a Visual Studio solution. In particular, if this is the first time you're building GDCM, I recommend:

BUILD_TESTING		OFF
GDCM_BUILD_EXAMPLES	OFF
GDCM_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS	OFF

	b) The created solution (GDCM.sln) will be in the build directory. Open it, and build the ALL_BUILD project.

	On Linux:

	a) Make a subdirectory of gdcm-1.2.5 called build (this will be a sibling of the source directory) and change to it.
	b) Run "ccmake ../source" and set the options as per the instructions for Windows above (except for GDCM_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, which should be set to ON).
	c) Run "make".

5. On Linux only, you additionally need to run "make install". This will put all the shared object files (dynamic libraries) in gdcm-1.2.5/install. These need to be copied to /usr/lib/ so that executables can find them.

Troubleshooting Note:

If this isn't possible (for example if you're using a computer on which you don't have root access), then you'll have to do it the annoying way using LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For example, you can run the test program test-gdcm-1.2.5 from within the millipede/install/bin/tests/test-gdcm-1.2.5/bin directory by doing:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../../../../libraries/gdcm-1.2.5/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./test-gdcm-1.2.5

Alternatively you can just set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH using export.

Note: To simplify this process (since the whole situation described is bound to occur), I've actually added a script file to run the program correctly. To invoke it, just run the program using "./test-gdcm-1.2.5.sh" (you'll first need to make it executable after each build using "chmod 755 test-gdcm-1.2.5.sh"). This is still clearly not the preferable way of doing things on a computer to which you have root access. If you happen to be working on an OUCL computer, I suggest asking Ian if he could install the libraries into /usr/lib for you.
